# th2 check1 (4.0.1)

## Overview

The component is responsible for verifying decoded messages.

Communication with the script takes place via grpc, messages are received via rabbit mq.

The component subscribes to the queues specified in the configuration and accumulates messages from them in a FIFO buffer. 

The buffer size is configurable, and it is set to 1000 by default.

When the component starts, the grpc server also starts and then the component waits for incoming grpc requests for verification.

# Verification requests

Available requests are described in [this repository](https://gitlab.exactpro.com/vivarium/th2/th2-core-open-source/th2-grpc-check1)

- CheckSequenceRuleRequest - prefilters the messages and verify all of them by filter. Order checking configured from request.
  Depending on the request and check1 configuration **SilenceCheckRule** can be added after the CheckSequenceRule.
  It verifies that there were not any messages matching the pre-filter in the original request.
  It awaits for realtime timeout that is equal to clean-up timeout.
  Reports about unexpected messages only after the timeout is exceeded. Reports nothing if any task is added to the chain.
- CheckRuleRequest - get message filter from request and check it with messages in the cache or await specified time in case of empty cache or message absence.
- NoMessageCheckRequest - prefilters messages and verifies that no other messages have been received.

## Request parameters

### Common

#### Required

* **parent_event_id** - all events generated by the rule will be attached to that event
* **connectivity_id** (the `session_alias` inside `connectivity_id` must not be empty)

#### Optional

* **direction** - the direction of messages to be checked by rule. By default, it is _FIRST_
* **chain_id** - the id to connect rules (rule starts checking after the previous one in the chain). Considers **connectivity_id**
* **description** - the description that will be added to the root event produced by the rule
* **timeout** - defines the allowed timeout for messages matching by real time. If not set the default value from check1 settings will be taken
* **message_timeout** - defines the allowed timeout for messages matching by the time they were received.
* **checkpoint** (must be set if `message_timeout` is used and no valid `chain_id` has been provided)

### CheckRuleRequest

#### Required

* **root_filter** or **filter** (please note, that the `filter` parameter is deprecated and will be removed in the future releases)

### CheckSequenceRuleRequest

#### Required

* **root_message_filters** or **message_filters** with at least one filter
  (please note, that the `message_filters` parameter is deprecated and will be removed in the future releases)

#### Optional
* **pre_filter** - pre-filtering for messages. Only messages that passed the filter will be checked by the main filters.
* **check_order** - enables order validation in message's collections
* **silence_check** - enables auto-check for messages that match the `pre_filter` after the rule has finished

### NoMessageCheckRequest

#### Optional
* **pre_filter** pre-filtering for messages that should not be received.

# Configuration

This block describes the configuration for check1.

### Configuration example
```json
{
  "message-cache-size": 1000,
  "cleanup-older-than": 60,
  "cleanup-time-unit": "SECONDS",
  "max-event-batch-content-size": "1048576",
  "rule-execution-timeout": 5000,
  "auto-silence-check-after-sequence-rule": false,
  "time-precision": "PT0.000000001S",
  "decimal-precision": 0.00001,
  "check-null-value-as-empty": false
}
```

### Properties description

#### message-cache-size
The number of messages for each stream (alias + direction) that will be buffered.

#### cleanup-older-than
The time before the verification chain (from a task that is complete) will be removed.
The value will be interpreted as time unit defined in _cleanup-time-unit_ setting. _The default value is set to 60_

#### cleanup-time-unit
The time unit for _cleanup-older-than_ setting. The available values are MILLIS, SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS. _The default value is set to SECONDS_

#### max-event-batch-content-size
The max size in bytes of summary events content in a batch defined in _max-event-batch-content-size_ setting. _The default value is set to 1048576_

#### rule-execution-timeout
The default rule execution timeout is used if no rule timeout is specified. Measured in milliseconds

#### auto-silence-check-after-sequence-rule
Defines a default behavior for creating CheckSequenceRule if `silence_check` parameter is not specified in the request. The default value is `false`

#### time-precision
The time precision is used to compare two time values. It is based on the `ISO-8601` duration format `PnDTnHnMn.nS` with days considered to be exactly 24 hours. Additional information can be found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/Duration.html#parse(java.lang.CharSequence))

#### decimal-precision
The decimal precision is used to compare the value of two numbers. Can be specified in number or string format. For example `0.0001`, `0.125`, `125E-3`

#### check-null-value-as-empty
`check-null-value-as-empty` is used for `EMPTY` and `NOT_EMPTY` operations to check if `NULL_VALUE` value is empty. By default, this parameter is set to `false`. For example, if the `checkNullValueAsEmpty` parameter is:
+ `true`, then `NULL_VALUE` is equal to `EMPTY`, otherwise `NULL_VALUE` is equal to `NOT_EMPTY`

## Required pins

The Check1 component has two types of pin:
* gRPC server pin: it allows other components to connect via `com.exactpro.th2.check1.grpc.Check1Service` class.
* MQ pin: it is used for listening to parsed messages. You can link several sources with different directions and session aliases to it.

```yaml
apiVersion: th2.exactpro.com/v1
kind: Th2Box
metadata:
  name: check1
spec:
  pins:
    - name: server
      connection-type: grpc
    - name: in_parsed_message
      connection-type: mq
      attributes:
        - "subscribe"
        - "parsed"
```

## Prometheus metrics
The Check1 component publishes Prometheus metrics to observe the actual state of it
* `th2_check1_actual_cache_number` - actual number of messages in caches
* `th2_check1_active_tasks_number` - actual number of currently working rules

The `th2_check1_actual_cache_number` metric separate messages with three labels:
* `book_name` - book name of received message
* `session_alias` - session alias of received message
* `direction` - direction of received message

The `th2_check1_active_tasks_number` metric separate rules with label `rule_type`
