# th2 check1 (4.9.0)

## Overview

The component is responsible for verifying decoded messages.

Communication with the script takes place via grpc, messages are received via rabbit mq.

The component subscribes to the queues specified in the configuration and accumulates messages from them in a FIFO
buffer.

The buffer size is configurable, and it is set to 1000 by default.

When the component starts, the grpc server also starts and then the component waits for incoming grpc requests for
verification.

# Verification requests

Available requests are described
in [this repository](https://github.com/th2-net/th2-grpc-check1/blob/dev-version-4/src/main/proto/th2_grpc_check1/check1.proto)

- CheckSequenceRuleRequest - prefilters the messages and verify all of them by filter. Order checking configured from
  request. Depending on the request and check1 configuration **SilenceCheckRule** can be added after the
  CheckSequenceRule. It verifies that there were not any messages matching the pre-filter in the original request. It
  awaits for realtime timeout that is equal to clean-up timeout. Reports about unexpected messages only after the
  timeout is exceeded. Reports nothing if any task is added to the chain.
- CheckRuleRequest - get message filter from request and check it with messages in the cache or await specified time in
  case of empty cache or message absence.
- WaitForResult - synchronous request waiting for the result of specified rule during specified timeout

## submitNoMessageCheck(NoMessageCheckRequest) returns (NoMessageCheckResponse)

This rule verifies that no messages are received by `check1` within a specified interval.

### Behavior and Configuration

- The message stream is defined using the **connectivity_id** and **direction** options.
- Filtering of incoming messages can be configured using the **pre_filter** option if the option is provided.
- The start of the check interval is determined by:
  - A checkpoint message corresponding to the specified **connectivity_id** and **direction**, if the **checkpoint** option is provided.
  - The last checked message in the chain, if **chain_id** is specified and `check1` maintains state for that chain.

### Completion Conditions

The rule completes under the following conditions:

- **Passed**:
  - If **message_timeout** is specified, the rule completes with a **PASSED** result when `check1` receives a message for **connectivity_id** and **direction**, and the message’s timeout exceeds the start message's timestamp by more than the **message_timeout** value.
  - If **timeout** is specified (or the default **rule-execution-timeout** is used), the rule completes with a **PASSED** result when this duration elapses without receiving any matching message.
- **Failed**:
  - The rule completes with a **FAILED** result if a message matching the **pre_filter** is received during the check interval.
  - If **pre_filter** is not specified, any message received during the check interval will cause the rule to fail.

## Request parameters

### Common

#### Required

* **parent_event_id** - all events generated by the rule will be attached to that event
* **connectivity_id** (the `session_alias` inside `connectivity_id` must not be empty)

#### Optional

* **direction** - the direction of messages to be checked by rule. By default, it is _FIRST_
* **chain_id** - the id to connect rules (rule starts checking after the previous one in the chain). Considers *
  *connectivity_id**
* **description** - the description that will be added to the root event produced by the rule
* **timeout** - defines the allowed timeout for messages matching by real time. If not set the default value from check1
  settings will be taken
* **store_result** - `true` indicates that the rule result should be stored for later request using `WaitForResult` method
* **message_timeout** - defines the allowed timeout for messages matching by the time they were received
* **checkpoint** (must be set if `message_timeout` is used and no valid `chain_id` has been provided)

### CheckRuleRequest

#### Required

* **root_filter** or **filter** (please note, that the `filter` parameter is deprecated and will be removed in the
  future releases)

### CheckSequenceRuleRequest

#### Required

* **root_message_filters** or **message_filters** with at least one filter
  (please note, that the `message_filters` parameter is deprecated and will be removed in the future releases)

#### Optional

* **pre_filter** - pre-filtering for messages. Only messages that passed the filter will be checked by the main filters.
* **check_order** - enables order validation in message's collections
* **silence_check** - enables auto-check for messages that match the `pre_filter` after the rule has finished

### NoMessageCheckRequest

#### Optional

* **pre_filter** pre-filtering for messages that should not be received.

### WaitForResult

#### Required

* **rule_id** - the id of rule
* **timeout** - timeout for waiting for result

### SubmitMultipleRules

#### Required

* **rules** - list of rules to submit

#### Optional

* **default_parent_event_id** - default value for `parent_event_id` of submitted rules.
* **default_chain** - default value for `parent_event_id` of submitted rules.

### PostMultipleRules

the same as `SubmitMultipleRules` but returns immediately with `Empty` response

# Configuration

This block describes the configuration for check1.

### Configuration example

```yaml
spec:
  customConfig:
    message-cache-size: '1000'
    cleanup-older-than: '60'
    cleanup-time-unit: 'SECONDS'
    max-event-batch-content-size: '1048576'

    await-root-event-storing-on-wait-for-result: false
    hide-operation-in-expected: false
    rules-execution-threads: 1
```

### Properties description

#### message-cache-size

The number of messages for each stream (alias + direction) that will be buffered.

#### cleanup-older-than

The time before the verification chain (from a task that is complete) will be removed. The value will be interpreted as
time unit defined in _cleanup-time-unit_ setting. _The default value is set to 60_

#### cleanup-time-unit

The time unit for _cleanup-older-than_ setting. The available values are MILLIS, SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS. _The default
value is set to SECONDS_

#### min-cleanup-interval-ms

Minimum interval between cleanups in milliseconds. Default value is 1000 milliseconds.

#### max-event-batch-content-size

The max size in bytes of summary events content in a batch defined in _max-event-batch-content-size_ setting. _The
default value is set to 1048576_

#### rule-execution-timeout

The default rule execution timeout is used if no rule timeout is specified. Measured in milliseconds

#### auto-silence-check-after-sequence-rule

Defines a default behavior for creating CheckSequenceRule if `silence_check` parameter is not specified in the request.
The default value is `false`

#### time-precision

The time precision is used to compare two time values. It is based on the `ISO-8601` duration format `PnDTnHnMn.nS` with
days considered to be exactly 24 hours. Additional information can be
found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/Duration.html#parse(java.lang.CharSequence))

#### decimal-precision

The decimal precision is used to compare the value of two numbers. Can be specified in number or string format. For
example `0.0001`, `0.125`, `125E-3`

#### check-null-value-as-empty

`check-null-value-as-empty` is used for `EMPTY` and `NOT_EMPTY` operations to check if `NULL_VALUE` value is empty. By
default, this parameter is set to `false`. For example, if the `checkNullValueAsEmpty` parameter is:

+ `true`, then `NULL_VALUE` is equal to `EMPTY`, otherwise `NULL_VALUE` is equal to `NOT_EMPTY`

#### enable-checkpoint-events-publication

Enables event publication for each stream that was added into checkpoint.
Otherwise, only top events with attached messages will be published.
_Enabled by default._

#### rules-execution-threads

Configures number of threads for rules execution. 
This option can help to increase performance when you are going to calculate heavy rules, and you haven't got strict CPU limitation,
otherwise use `1` thread for rule execution.
The default value is `1`

#### await-root-event-storing-on-wait-for-result

Enables functionality to wait rule root event storing during `waitForResult` gRPC method execution.
When user calls `waitForResult` gRPC method, check1 waits rule completion. If the rule is completed with FAILURE status, check1 pulls `getEvent` gRPC method of `lw-data-provider` to verify that rule root event is stored.
The grpc client pin  is required when the option is true:
```yaml
spec:
  customConfig:
    await-root-event-storing-on-wait-for-result: ture
  pins:
    grpc:
      client: 
        - name: to_lw_data_provider
          serviceClass: com.exactpro.th2.dataprovider.lw.grpc.DataProviderService
          linkTo:
            - box: lw-data-provider
              pin: server
```
_Disabled by default._

#### hide-operation-in-expected

Hides operation name from expected values for operations: `IN`, `NOT_IN`, `LIKE`, `NOT_LIKE`, `WILDCARD`, `NOT_WILDCARD`

| operation      | option false              | option true      |
|----------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| `IN`           | `IN [opt-1, opt-2]`       | `[opt-1, opt-2]` |
| `NOT_IN`       | `NOT_IN [opt-1, opt-2]`   | `[opt-1, opt-2]` |
| `LIKE`         | `LIKE regex.*`            | `regex.*`        |
| `NOT_LIKE`     | `NOT_LIKE regex.*`        | `regex.*`        |
| `WILDCARD`     | `WILDCARD wildcard?*`     | `wildcard?*`     |
| `NOT_WILDCARD` | `NOT_WILDCARD wildcard?*` | `wildcard?*`     |

_Disabled by default._

## Required pins

The Check1 component has two types of pin:

* gRPC server pin: it allows other components to connect via `com.exactpro.th2.check1.grpc.Check1Service` class.
* MQ pins: they are used for listening to th2 transport parsed messages. You can link several sources with
  different directions and session aliases to it.

```yaml
spec:
  pins:
    mq:
      subscribers:
        - name: from_codec_transport
          attributes: [subscribe, transport-group]
          linkTo:
            - box: <box name>
              pin: <box's pin name>
    grpc:
      server:
        - name: server
          serviceClasses:
            - com.exactpro.th2.check1.grpc.Check1Service
```

## Prometheus metrics

The Check1 component publishes Prometheus metrics to observe the actual state of it

* `th2_check1_actual_cache_number` - actual number of messages in caches
* `th2_check1_active_tasks_number` - actual number of currently working rules

The `th2_check1_actual_cache_number` metric separate messages with three labels:

* `book_name` - book name of received message
* `session_alias` - session alias of received message
* `direction` - direction of received message

The `th2_check1_active_tasks_number` metric separate rules with label `rule_type`
